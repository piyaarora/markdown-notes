# Lists

There are two types of lists :

### 1) unordered list
To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ). Each list item also gets its own line. 

example:
* Milk
* Eggs
* Salmon
* Butter

### 2) ordered list
An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks.

example:
1. tea
2. coffee
2. milk  (3 was given 2 in markup but it automatically understands the code.)

### 3) Nesting in list
All is same you only have to do is intend each asterisk(*) one space more than the preceding item.

example: 
* Tintin
    * A reporter
    * Has poofy orange hair
    * Friends with the world's most awesome dog
* Haddock
    * A sea captain
    * Has a fantastic beard
    * Loves whiskey
        * Possibly also scotch?
