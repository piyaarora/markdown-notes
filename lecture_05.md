# Blockquotes in markdown
If you need to call special attention to a quote from another source, or design a pull quote for a magazine article, then Markdown's blockquote syntax will be useful.

A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader. It can be added by using "greater than" caret (>).

example:
 >"Priya is honest"


you can use caret to multiple lines like

example:
>"Good to see you"

>How are you
