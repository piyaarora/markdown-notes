# Blockquotes in markdown

If you need to call special attention to a quote from another source, or design a pull quote for a magazine article, then Markdown's blockquote syntax will be useful.

A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader. It can be added by using "greater than" caret (>).

example:
 >"Priya is honest"

you can use caret to multiple lines like for line break use single(>)

example:
>"Good to see you"
>
>How are you

## ** Nested Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

example:  
> hey you are intelligent.
>
>> but you can perform better.

## ** Blockquotes with other elements

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

>  #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
