# Paragraphs or poetry writing.

we usually break line or press enter to move to nother line so that we can start our new paragraph. This is called hard break. and this increases space between the lines.

example:

here is line 1 after 2 enters.

here is line 2 after 2 enters.

This increases the spacing between lines and this is not suitable for poetry writing.

## using soft core
we can brea this pattern of entering twice by replacing two spaces after each new line.

example:
here is the common pattern.  
Thus i moved to next line.  
Again by entering 2 space after dot.
