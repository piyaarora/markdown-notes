# Code

To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

example :   
`x+y = z;`


## Escaping backticks

If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (``).

example:  
``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``

# Code blocks

To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

    <html>
        <head> 
            this is head
        </head>
    </html>
