# Links in markdown

## Inline link
There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). 

example: Creating hyperlink www.github.com is  [Visit Github](www.github.com)

## Reference link
The other link type is called a reference link. As the name implies, the link is actually a reference to another place in the document. Here's an example of what we mean:

example:
1) Here's [a link to something else][another place].
2) Here's [yet another link][another-link].
3) And now back to [the first link][another place].

[another place]: www.github.com
[another-link]: www.google.com
